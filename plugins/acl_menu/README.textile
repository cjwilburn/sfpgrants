h2. Acl Menu Plugin

This plugin provides a component for generating menus based off of the current user session and integrates well with the "AcoExtras Plugin":http://github.com/markstory/acl_extras/tree/master I also maintain. See "mark-story.com for additional info and usage":http://mark-story.com/posts/view/acl-menu-component

To use the menu once in a @acl_menu@ dir on your pluginPaths.

	var $components = array('AclMenu.Menu');

When checking out this repo place it into an @acl_menu@ directory in one of your plugin paths.
